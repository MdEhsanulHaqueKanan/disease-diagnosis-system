This project is an end-to-end web application that leverages Natural Language Processing to assist users in identifying potential diseases based on their described symptoms. It uses a state-of-the-art Sentence-Transformer model to understand the semantic meaning of symptoms, providing more accurate and context-aware results than simple keyword matching.

The entire application is built with a production-ready mindset, separating the data science development (in a Jupyter Notebook) from the deployed Flask application, ensuring efficiency and maintainability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Semantic Symptom Search:** Utilizes a memory-efficient Sentence-Transformer model (`paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2`) to understand the *meaning* of user input, not just keywords.
*   **Ranked Results with Confidence Score:** Returns the top 5 most likely diseases, ranked by their cosine similarity score, giving users a sense of the model's confidence.
*   **Clean, Responsive UI:** A modern and intuitive user interface built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provides a seamless user experience.
*   **Production-Ready Backend:** A robust Flask API, containerized with Docker, that loads the ML model artifacts once at startup for maximum performance.
*   **Cloud-Deployed:** Fully deployed on Render, demonstrating a complete end-to-end MLOps workflow from development to production.

### **The "Two-Phase" Philosophy**
1.  **Phase 1 (Development - The Notebook):** The `notebook/data_exploration_and_modeling.ipynb` notebook is used for all heavy-lifting. It handles data loading, cleaning, EDA, and the computationally expensive process of generating embeddings. Its final output is the lightweight, ready-to-use **model artifacts**.
2.  **Phase 2 (Production - The Flask App):** The `app.py` is a lightweight server. It does **not** re-run any data science processes. It simply loads the pre-computed artifacts from `model_artifacts/` once at startup and uses them to serve predictions quickly. This separation is a core MLOps principle.

## üß† From Development to Deployment: A Note on Model Selection

A key challenge in this project was bridging the gap between an ideal development environment and a real-world production deployment with resource constraints. This process demonstrates a crucial aspect of professional machine learning engineering.

*   **Initial Development:** In the Jupyter Notebook, the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model was initially used. It provided the highest semantic search accuracy during local testing.

*   **Deployment Challenge:** The initial deployment attempts on Render's free tier failed due to "Out of Memory" errors. The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model, while accurate, had a memory footprint that exceeded the 512MB RAM limit of the free instance.

*   **The Engineering Trade-off:** To ensure a successful and stable deployment, a pragmatic decision was made to switch to a more lightweight model: `paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2`. While this model has a slightly lower theoretical accuracy, its significantly smaller memory footprint allows the application to run smoothly and reliably on a cost-effective hosting plan.

This process highlights a critical real-world MLOps skill: **optimizing and selecting models not just for accuracy, but for performance and feasibility within a given production environment.**
